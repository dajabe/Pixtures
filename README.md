# Pixtures

## What

A fixture picture maker. Save details for teams and up coming games. Create templates with custom headings, logos and backgrounds. Export weekly, monthly, special event fixture posters as pdf, png, or jpg.

Well that's the dream. See TODO for things to come

## Guides

Some principles I am going to follow in the design of this application.

* Mobile first design
* Tests for all modules
* Intuitive interface
* Keep backend and frontend separate
* Browser, then app front ends

## Libs
Libraries that are being considered or are in use

### Using
* TBC
### Consider
* [Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer)


## TODO

This is the very start of my project and here are the features I think an app like this should have.

* Design architecture for application.
* Create object to store relevant data
* Create single page to display that data
* Figure out how to export export and save as pdf/png/jpg
* Start with simple form page
* Move to database based
* Setup accounts
* Design UX
* Create templates
* Allow users to create templates (limit number of templates stored)
* Allow import and export of templates
